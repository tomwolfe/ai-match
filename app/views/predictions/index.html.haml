-title "Predictions of who you're likely to match with"

%p
  Updated nightly. Check back to see who our algorithm predicts will be a good match for you based on who you've already matched with and disliked. Only showing users you've yet to rate. Sorted by highest predictions of a match. It should ideally learn who you will match with, so you shouldn't have to filter by gender/orientation/etc. It will improve with more data but will never be perfect. More filtering options may be added depending on necessity.
