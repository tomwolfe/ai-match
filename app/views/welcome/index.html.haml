%h2 Less swiping, more matching.
%p
  Finds users that are most likely to match with one another using a recommender system trained on dislikes and mutual likes. The more you like/dislike other users, the smarter it gets. Matches are generated nightly. We judge our success not by how many active users we have, but by how may users pair up and deactivate (your likes will still help others still looking) their accounts.
  
%p
  Pre-Alpha status, very unfinished, but finding users near you, rating users, viewing mutual likes, viewing who liked you, and messaging users is possible. Users over 18 can only see and rate users over 18, between 13-18 can only see and rate those of the same age group. Our matching algorithm is coming soon.
